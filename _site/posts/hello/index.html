<h2>nice to meet you</h2>
<p>since this is basically just a test page, why don't i tell you a little bit about myself?</p>
<p>i am a proud midwestern american with a long-lived interest in all things technology. this is hardly my first wesbite, this is merely the version of it you're seeing today.</p>
<p>when i'm not busy being a chronically online liberal, i can be found doing college work as a strive to obtain my first assosiates degree in computer information systems.</p>
<p>outside of that, i love infrastrucutre, urban planning, engineering, pop music, and my very supportive friends and family.</p>
<hr>
<p>on the topic of pop music, why don't i share my favorite groups? in 2024, you'll find me listening to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magdalena Bay</li>
<li>Luna Li</li>
<li>Take Van</li>
<li>Ginger Root</li>
<li>Men I Trust</li>
<li>Reina</li>
<li>Japanese Breakfast</li>
<li>Calica</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more not listed here!</p>
<p>honestly, i have no idea why I came to like pop so much. maybe it's the vibes. i'll let you know if i ever figure it out.</p>
<hr>
<p>i hope to maybe keep this beautiful site updated, but if i don't, at least this nice little static site can continue to justify the $6 a month i spend on hosting, and the $18 a year i spend on the cardnial.com domain name.</p>
<p>anyways, if you suriously read this to the end, thanks i guess. you can have this cookie as a reward. <a href="https://placecats.com/neo_banana/1280/720">üç™</a></p>

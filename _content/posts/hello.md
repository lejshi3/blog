# hello!

## nice to meet you

since this is basically just a test page, why don't i tell you a little bit about myself?

i am a proud midwestern american with a long-lived interest in all things technology. this is hardly my first wesbite, this is merely the version of it you're seeing today.

when i'm not busy being a chronically online liberal, i can be found doing college work as a strive to obtain my first assosiates degree in computer information systems.

outside of that, i love infrastrucutre, urban planning, engineering, pop music, and my very supportive friends and family.

on the topic of pop music, why don't i share my favorite groups? in 2024, you'll find me listening to:

- Magdalena Bay
- Luna Li
- Take Van
- Ginger Root
- Men I Trust
- Reina
- Japanese Breakfast
- Calica

and many more not listed here!

honestly, i have no idea why I came to like pop so much. maybe it's the vibes. i'll let you know if i ever figure it out.

i hope to maybe keep this beautiful site updated, but if i don't, at least this nice little static site can continue to justify the $6 a month i spend on hosting, and the $18 a year i spend on the cardnial.com domain name.

anyways, if you suriously read this to the end, thanks i guess. you can have this cookie as a reward. [üç™](https://placecats.com/neo_banana/1280/720)

remember kids; trans rights are human rights, register to vote at [vote.gov](https://vote.gov), don't vape, don't do drugs, and love your neighbor.
